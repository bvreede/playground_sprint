Can you use Git and push to Github from your IDE? Experiment with editing and committing on github itself. You can then download your code to your local repository using git pull. Optional: What happens if you edit the same file online and locally, and try to push/pull? (Hint: this often causes a merge conflict, which is no fun to experience.
